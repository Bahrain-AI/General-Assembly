<a href="/20230626/support-structures-for-the-extremely-online" style="text-decoration-color:var(--grey-outlined)"><h3>Support Structures for the Extremely Online</h3></a>

  

  <p>I am what some folks might call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremely_online">Extremely Online</a>. I’ve certainly wrestled with this at times, and there have been moments when I feel the need to pull back from incessantly scrolling through whatever timeline is in vogue (for me these days that’s Mastodon) and commenting with meme GIFs.</p>

<p>But I’ve come to accept my fate. Furthermore, <strong>this is something I’m good at</strong>. Yes that right, I’m good at internetting (for better or worse). What I’m <em>not</em> so good at is occasionally dipping my toe into the water of being <strong>Extremely Offline</strong>.</p>

<p>Intentionally going offline is <em>vital</em> to my mental health (and yours too). For some people that might not prove such a huge issue as they have family ties or other social commitments IRL to attend to. For me though—except for the times I’m actively involved in playing with/supervising/teaching/going on adventures with my kids—I’m basically a single (divorced) dude who remote works, <a href="https://simplepraxis.life/2019/leaving-it-all-behind-my-exvangelical-story">quit attending church years ago</a>, and whose extended family all live out-of-state.</p>

<p>If I’m going to have a social life apart from opening up yet another chat window, I need to <strong>wrangle my own support structure out of thin air</strong>.</p>

<p>And so that’s exactly what I’ve been doing this spring and summer. I’ve had to push myself—<em>force</em> myself some days—to get out there and Meet Real People. It doesn’t always come naturally to me, but I’m <em>always</em> glad when I do it.</p>

<p>Shout out to <a href="https://meetup.com">Meetup</a> which—despite a rocky road these past few years first being acquired by WeWork and then being let go among all the zaniness there—still seems to be going strong and providing <strong>an excellent way of discovering groups of people IRL doing interesting things</strong>.</p>

<p>I’ve gone on hikes, focused on writing alongside fellow artists and creatives, laughed it up playing a wacky party game at a dinner event, and, yes, hung out with some local techies too. I’ve also been keeping an eye out for festivals or other fun community activities I might participate in. What will I be up to next? Who knows!</p>

<p>Having the sense of a local support structure apart from pixels on a screen, being able to look fellow humans in the eye and make a genuine emotional and intellectual connection, is something <strong>I simply don’t take for granted</strong>. Having lived through a pandemic and been Extremely-Extremely Online for weeks or even months at a time (most of 2020 is simply a blur to me, I can’t remember WTF I was even doing), a couple of hours of levity over a beer or walking along a forest path pointing out a grand vista or a word of encouragement from another creator in the room…<strong>these are moments I treasure</strong>. And I can’t wait for more.</p>

<p>If you feel like you need more of a support structure where you live, <strong>what’s that single first step you might be able to take today?</strong></p>

<a href="/20230612/reddit-unethical-from-the-start" style="text-decoration-color:var(--grey-outlined)"><h3>Surprise Surprise! Reddit Was Unethical from the Start</h3></a>

  

  <p>As Reddit radically implodes (8000+ subreddits have gone dark as of the time of this writing!) due to the hubris and nearsightedness of its leaders, it’s worth considering what really goes into the DNA of an online social platform.</p>

<p>I once worked on an industry-specific social platform of sorts at a (now defunct) startup.  They came up with the brilliant strategy to invent a bunch of randomized nonsense visitor stats for <em>“claim this!”</em> profiles of various people in their industry (scraped from god knows which email/phone databases) to get people to join the platform. I pushed back on the idea of essentially bald-face lying to everyone as a wise marketing strategy, but I was overruled. If memory serves, I ended up building this feature. Yup, I just went along with it. Hey, a fella (and relatively new dad!) has to make a living! 🫠</p>

<p><strong>It remains one of my biggest regrets of all time.</strong> I think about what I did often. I was one of them! One of “those programmers” who produces bullshit at the behest of faulty biz dev asshattery. <em>Never again.</em></p>

<p>Which is why <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/06/reddit-founders-made-hundreds-of-fake-profiles-so-site-looked-popular/">this story about Reddit founders making hundreds of fake profiles so site looked popular</a> from all the way back in 2012 is so enraging (and I rather wish I’d known about this already). Reddit quite literally faked its popularity in order to become popular. Yes, it’s true that jumpstarting large online communities is super challenging, and one can be forgiven for giving into a certain bit of temptation to mask any whiff of appearing like a ghost town. Yet I’m certain Reddit could have found a more ethical route than simply seeding their database with fake users…even all the way back 11 years ago. (And before a reply guy waltzes in to tell me that well actually all the big social platforms seeded their communities/content like this, I really don’t give a shit. It’s wrong when Reddit does it. It’s wrong when Facebook does it, or Twitter, or whoever. Don’t do it.)</p>

<p>Words matter. Intent matters. Artistry matters. Integrity matters. And karma’s a, well, you know. I think Reddit’s seeing the “comes around” end of the cycle playing out right now, and—though I wish otherwise—I doubt we’ll witness a sudden illumination and genuine display of repentance at Snoo HQ. Expect even more <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/tag/enshittification" class="hashtag">#enshittification</a> in the days ahead.</p>
